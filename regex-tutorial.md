## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors belong to the family of regex tokens that don't match any characters.
- ^(caret) - Matches at the start of the string the regex pattern is applied to.
- $(dollar) - Matches at the end of the string the regex pattern is applied to.

Examples
- `^` matches `a` in abc/ndef
- `$` matches `f` in abc/ndef
